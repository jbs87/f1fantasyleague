Brainstorming
-------------

As a User,
  I want to Login, 
  so that I can play the game.

  after I login  want to see my profile,
  so that I can make team updates.

  I want to see the current 'transfer market'
  so that I can make an informed decision on for the next race.

  I want to select my team line up before each race,
  so that I can maximize my score.

  

As an Admin,
  I want to login,
  so that I can manage User accounts.
