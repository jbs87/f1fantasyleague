      <h1>Game Rules</h1>

      <h2>Scoring points</h2>

      <p>The game has 19 rounds, with each being a round of this year’s F1 World Championship. At each round, you are able to score points from both qualifying and the race.</p>

      <p>In the scoring overview, you can see how points are distributed for each qualifying and race position.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A driver who does not classify as finished in the race results will not earn you any points</li>
        <li> Because the 107% rule has been reintroduced for the 2011 season, all drivers who fail to qualify will receive the maximum devaluation per race as a penalty.</li>
        <li> In the event of governing body the FIA changing a Grand Prix result - for any reason - on the Monday or Tuesday after the race, the game results will be recalculated accordingly; the F1 Manager results published immediately after the race are therefore unofficial</li>
        <li> On the Tuesday 16:00 (GMT) after the start of the race, the results become official; after this time, should the FIA make any changes to the result of the race, the results of the GPUpdateManager.net game will NOT be amended. At this point, the transfer market will also be opened in order to allow changes to teams</li>
      </ul>

      <p> The number of points you have scored will decide your position in the standings. If, at the end of the season, two or more managers hold with the same number of points, the one with the largest remaining budget will be declared the winner. In the event of matching budgets, a winner will be selected at random by game organisers.</p>

      <h4>Same engine brands</h4>

      <p>When you buy a Cosworth engine please be aware the engine will only score you points with the driver that is using the Cosworth engine you picked. In other words, if you buy Marussia Virgin Racing's Cosworth engine its drivers will score you points. Any other driver from an other team also using Cosworth engines will not score you any points.</p>

      <h2>How to create a team</h2>

      <p>A team in the F1 Manager game consists of two drivers, a chassis and an engine - you will need all of these in place to complete your team and play the F1 Manager game this season.</p>

      <p>Players are permitted to use only one element of each Formula 1 team in your own team. For example, if you select Kimi Räikkönen as a driver you cannot buy the Ferrari engine, as Felipe is powered by the Ferrari engine this year.</p>

      <p>Every manager receives a virtual start-up budget of $100 million and your first line-up must be established by spending no more than this amount. The prices of all elements in the game are fixed before the start of the season but will fluctuate during the year, according to their individual performances.</p>

      <h4>Exceptional mid-season changes</h4>

      <p>In the event of a selected driver missing a race, for any reason, you will not be eligible for scoring points with any replacement driver; to be able to score points, you will be required to change the absent driver with the replacement in order to prevent sacrificing points.</p>

      <p>In the event of a selected driver switching team mid-season, the given driver will remain in your F1 Manager team. Should a driver change result in a component clash – eg. you then find two McLaren associates in your line-up – this will be permitted until your next team modification is made.</p>
      
      <h2>Team values and scoring</h2>

      <p>As a manager, you can spend $100 million from the start of the season. With this budget, you must purchase two drivers, a chassis and an engine.</p>

      <p>With every race which passes, players will earn money with every point scored, with each point translating to $50.000 – as a result, the more points you score, the more money you will earn for enhancing your team.</p>

      <p>At the start of the season every driver, chassis and engine will have be assigned to a fixed value. As the season progresses, the values of drivers, chassis and engines will fluctuate depending on on-track performances; for example, a driver’s value will rise by <1></1>9 million in the event of him winning a Grand Prix; should he finish 20th, his value will fall by $3.5 million, making him cheaper to purchase for the next Grand Prix.</p>

      <p>The maximum value of a driver is $150 million with the minimum being $1 million. If a driver misses a race(s), his value will remain unchanged.</p>

      <p>You can spend the money you earn throughout the season in order to improve your team, in a bid to score more points at the following race.</p>

      <h2>Making changes to your team</h2>

      <p>After every race, players are able to make changes to their team, being able to buy and sell elements ahead of the following Grand Prix.</p>

      <p>The transfer market will not open until 72 hours after the start of the race and will close as soon as the following race’s qualifying session begins.</p>

      <p>In all cases, players wishing to buy a new driver/chassis/engine will first be required to sell an existing element.</p>

      <p>Players selling an item will receive 100% of its original value.</p>

      <p>On the transfer market page you will find a complete overview for the values of drivers, engines and chassis.</p>

      <p>In the event of a team or driver not completing the season, it/they will remain in the game without scoring points for your team, should an element be included in your line-up; to continue being eligible for points scoring with every part of your team, non-competing parties in your line-up must be sold and replaced.</p>
